# üçî McDonald's Sales Analysis Project

This project performs a comprehensive, SQL-driven analysis of McDonald's sales data to identify core business trends, optimize the menu, and improve operational efficiency.

The analysis covers **5,370 total orders** and **$61,626.29 in total revenue**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **SQL (MySQL/SQL Server):** Used for data cleaning, aggregation, calculating KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and complex query execution.
* **Data Visualization (Power BI/Excel):** Utilized to transform raw data into a dynamic dashboard for visual storytelling and clear communication of insights.

## üìä Key Business Insights

The analysis focused on transforming sales data into actionable business strategies:

| Focus Area | Key Finding / Insight | Business Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Menu Strategy** | **Side Salad** was the most frequently ordered item, while **Burgers and Chicken** were the highest revenue categories. | Leverage high-revenue categories (Burgers/Chicken) in promotions, and investigate the popularity driver for the Side Salad. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Identified **peak ordering days (e.g., Monday/Tuesday)** and specific hours of high sales velocity. | Adjust staff scheduling to match customer demand on peak days/hours to minimize wait times and maximize service quality. |
| **Financial Performance**| Provided a detailed breakdown of revenue and order counts across all menu categories. | Use category performance data for targeted inventory stocking and future menu development planning. |
